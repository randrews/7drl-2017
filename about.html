      <h1>How to Play:</h1>
      <p>Caverns of Sevendral is focused on combat. Enemies walk toward the player, after every player move.</p>
      <p>If you're next to an enemy, and the space behind them is empty, you can bump into them to shove them away:</p>

      <p>If you walk toward an enemy from one space away, you will attack them and kill them:</p>

      <p>Spells can also be used to kill enemies, best to save them to get out of a jam.</p>
